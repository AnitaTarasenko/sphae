1. viralVerify error to consider: 

    Error: Sequence file /home/nala0006/scratch/spae-paper/illumina/sra-paired_out_v1.4.2/PROCESSING/assembly/megahit/SRR26348618-pr/final.contigs_proteins_circ.fa is empty or misformatted

    - wrong file 
    - correct file with final_contigs.fa has really short contigs- filter for this earlier
  
2. add a genome coverage to the summary file - genome length/rasusa subsample reads count
3. add another module to map the reads to the assembled genome 
    - other fun things to do here
    - calculate the mutations/variants per postion?
